# Weather-app
About: This is my personal project in which I made a simple weather information application using Python's Tkinter library and OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for a specific city by entering the city name.

Features
Display Weather: Users can enter the name of a city and click the "Display Weather" button to retrieve and display weather information, including weather description, temperature, feels-like temperature, and wind speed.
Default City Text: The entry widget for entering the city name has a default text "Enter city" which gets replaced with a blank space when clicked, allowing users to enter the city name easily.
API Integration: The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for the entered city.
